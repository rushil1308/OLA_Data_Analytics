# OLA_Data_Analytics

An end-to-end data analysis project using SQL, Google Sheets, and Power BI.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Data source)
- SQL (Data cleaning and transformation)
- Power BI Desktop (Visualization and report building)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Ola ride data to identify trends in ride frequency, revenue, city-wise demand, and customer behavior.

## How to Use
1. Download the .pbix file and open it in Power BI Desktop.
2. Review SQL scripts and sample data provided.

## Advance Queries solved on SQL
1. Which customers have a history of giving an average rating above 4.5 and have less than 2 cancellations?
2. Which customers cancelled rides frequently after booking within 5 minutes?
3. What is the standard deviation of driver ratings per driver to assess consistency?
4. Which day of the week has the highest average number of successful bookings?
5. Which vehicle type has the highest ratio of successful rides to cancellations?
6. Which customers booked the same vehicle type more than 5 times?
7. What is the total booking value split by each payment method for successful rides?
8. During which hour of the day do most bookings occur?
9. Which customers have not booked any ride in the last 30 days?
10. Which drivers completed the highest number of rides per day?
